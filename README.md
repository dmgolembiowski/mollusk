# Mollusk (`fish` + `xonsh`)

The best parts of `fish` and the best parts of `xonsh`. I really like `xonsh`,
but `fish`'s was way superior to `xonsh`'s. But I also love the fact that
`xonsh` has its whole state as Python objects. So I decided to combine the two.

This code is 100% garbage. It's very hacky, spawning a new fish shell for
every command, and yet is still faster than xonsh on its commands.

## Installation
I'll add something here sometime.

## TODO
 - Fix syntax highlighting
 - Multi-line command support
 - Robustness against breaking the internal xonsh interpreter
